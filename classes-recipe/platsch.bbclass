# Class to simplify the conversion of images to be displayed by "platsch" as splash images
#
# Description:
#
# "platsch" expects raw bitmaps in a format that the target's graphics
# hardware's display controller is able to scan out without further pre-
# processing. This class helps creating them starting from conventionally
# formatted images whose filenames have to satisfy the following scheme:
#
#   <base>-<width>x<height>.<extension>
#
# In the recipe the conventional images to be converted are listed and the raw
# format that they shall be converted to is specified:
#
#   SPLASH_IMAGES = "splash-1280x800.png splash-800x480.png"
#   SPLASH_FORMAT = "RGB565"
#
# Of course, those source images have to be listed in SRC_URI beforehand.
#
# If the raw format that you need for your hardware is not supported by this
# class up to now, you are invited to create a corresponding pull request.
#
# ImageMagick's BMP encoder always creates "bottom-up" bitmap data whereas the
# i.MX6/i.MX8 expect the pixel array to be stored "top-down" so that one needs
# to compensate for it by flipping the image during the conversion (see [1] and
# [2] further down). To make things like that possible there is the bitbake
# parameter SPLASH_MGK_CUSTOM_OPTION which is weakly predefined to flip the
# image and which can be overwritten in any recipe utilizing this class if
# required.
#
# If the resulting images shall not be installed to the default location (which
# is /usr/share/platsch) choose another directory via
#
#   SPLASH_DATADIR = "/some/different/directory"
#
# Finally the class automatically appends the converted images to the
# FILES:${PN} parameter.
